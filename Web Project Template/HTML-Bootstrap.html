<!--HTML file set up to include Bootstrap -->

<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  HTML is the standard language for creating Web pages.  HTML describes the structure and puts content on the Web page. -->

<!-- Starting a HTML file with the following two lines defines it as a HTML document and specifies the language of the content-->

<!Doctype html>
<html lang="en-us">

<!-- The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information. -->

<head>

 <!--<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. 
 Metadata is used by browsers and will not be displayed on the page.   
--> 
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!-- The title goes inside the <head> element and specifies the title for the HTML page and is shown in the page's tab.  It will not show on the web page -->

    <!-- Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development.  Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins.  Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.

    <!-- Bootstrapâ€™s responsive (adapts to screen size) grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.  The following two "container" and "row" lines must be in the beginning of the <body> element to use this feature. -->
